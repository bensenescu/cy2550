I selected dashlane as my password manager. It alongside 1password and LastPass
were the password managers I was previously familiar. I have a startup which I 
am the tech lead for so I was also evaluating the password managers for my 
company. This is why I selected dashlane as it seemed to have the best / most 
user friendly solution from a admin pespective. I especially liked its distinctions 
of "vaults" which let users have personal password vaults for their facebook, 
password vaults for their company emails and other credentials, as well as shared
vaults for credentials such as our company socials.
